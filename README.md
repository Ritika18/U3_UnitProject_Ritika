<h1>(Name of Game)</h1>

<h1>By: Ritika Kacholia</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>My final project is using makey makey and Box2D. This game is basically two characters, one on each side of the platform, who are
fighting against each other trying to reach an object placed at the other end of the platform. The object of the game is to not allow
the other player to reach their object, before you can reach your own object. This is going to be using makey makey while standing. So
in order to move your character you have to physically move.</p>
